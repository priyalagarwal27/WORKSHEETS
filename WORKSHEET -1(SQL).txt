Ans11. Data-Warehouse :-
    -> A Data Warehouse is a type of data management system that is designed to enable and support business intelligence (BI) activities, especially analystics. 
    -> Data Warehouse are solely intended to perform qureries and analysis and after contain large amount of historical data. 
    -> The data within a data warehouse is usually derived from wide range of source such as application log files and transaction.

Ans12. Difference between OLTP vs. OLAP :-
   a. OLAP is used for data analysis like sales analysis, market research. Example: Data Warehouse. 
      OLTP is used to manage very large number of online short transaction. Example: ATM.
   b. OLAP uses data warehouse.
      OLTP uses traditional DBMS.
   c. OLAP manages all insert,update and delete transaction.
      OLTP is mainly used for data reading.

Ans13.Characteristics of Data Warehouse :-
    a.Subject-Oriented:- They can analyze data about a paticular subject or functional area (such as sales).
    b.Integrated:- Data warehouse create consistency among different datatypes from disparate sources.
    c.NonVolatile:- Once data is in a data warehouse, it is stable and doesn't change.
    d.Time-Variant:- Data warehouse analysis looks at change overtime.
    The data warehouse serves as the functional foundation for middleware BI environments that provides end users with reports, dashboard and other interface.

Ans14. Star-Schema :-
    -> The Star Schema architecture is the simplest data warehouse schema. 
    -> It is called a star schema because the diagram resembles a star, with points radiating from center. 
    -> The center of the star consist of fact table and the point of the star are the dimension tables. 
    -> Usually the fact tables in a star are in third normal form (3NF) where as dimensional tables are de-normalized. 
    -> Despite the fact that the star-schema is the simplest architecture it is most commonly used nowdays and is recommended by oracle.

Ans15. SETL :- 
    -> Short for Set Theory as a Language (or set language).
    -> SETL is a high-level-programming language that's based on the mathematical theory of sets. 
    -> It was developed in the early 1970's by mathematician Professor J.Schwartz.
    -> SETL is an resembles C and in many cases similar to Perl.
    -> In SETL every statment is terminated by a semicolon(;).
    -> Variables names are automatically determined by their last assignment.
